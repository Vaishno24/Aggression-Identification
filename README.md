# Aggression-Identification

In this Project, we have implemented several Machine Learning and Deep Learning models using the TF-IDF
Vectorization , Word Embeddings using LSTM Neural architecture, and BERT transformer architecture
combined with Deep neural networks using methods to classify aggression in social media mainly Twitter and
Facebook content into three categories: Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive, and Non-Aggressive
